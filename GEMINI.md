# Vibe Coding Guide - AI Assistant Context

</div>

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Vibe Coding** is a comprehensive guide and workflow for AI-assisted pair programming. The goal is to provide a structured and efficient way to turn ideas into reality by leveraging the power of AI. This project is not about a specific programming language or framework, but rather a methodology that can be applied to any software development project.

The core of the project is a collection of documents, prompts, and tools that guide the developer and the AI assistant through the entire development process, from initial conception to final implementation.

## 的核心理念 (Core Philosophy)

The "Vibe Coding" methodology is based on the following key principles:

*   **Planning is everything:** A detailed implementation plan is created before any code is written. This plan is then executed step-by-step, with each step being tested and verified before moving on to the next.
*   **Modularization:** The project is broken down into small, manageable modules that can be developed and tested independently.
*   **Context is king:** The AI assistant is provided with a "memory-bank" of all the relevant project documents, such as the game design document, tech stack, and implementation plan. This ensures that the AI has a deep understanding of the project's context and can provide accurate and relevant assistance.
*   **AI as a partner:** The AI assistant is not just a code generator, but a true partner in the development process. The developer and the AI work together, with the developer providing the high-level guidance and the AI providing the low-level implementation details.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The most important files and directories in this project are:

*   `README.md`: The main entry point for the project, providing an overview and links to all the other resources.
*   `i18n/`: Contains the internationalization files for the project, with subdirectories for each supported language.
*   `i18n/en/`: The English version of the project documentation.
*   `i18n/zh/`: The Chinese version of the project documentation.
*   `libs/`: Contains common library code that can be used across different projects.
*   `prompts/`: A collection of prompts for different stages of the development process.
*   `skills/`: A collection of reusable skills that can be used to extend the functionality of the AI assistant.

## 🤖 AI Assistant's Role

As the AI assistant for this project, you are expected to:

*   **Be a true partner:** Work collaboratively with the developer to achieve the project's goals.
*   **Be proactive:** Ask clarifying questions and provide suggestions to improve the project.
*   **Be a good communicator:** Clearly explain your reasoning and provide detailed explanations of your work.
*   **Be a good learner:** Continuously learn from your interactions with the developer and the project's context.
*   **Follow the "Vibe Coding" methodology:** Adhere to the principles of plan-driven development, modularization, and context-awareness.

By following these guidelines, you will be able to provide the best possible assistance to the developer and help them turn their ideas into reality.
