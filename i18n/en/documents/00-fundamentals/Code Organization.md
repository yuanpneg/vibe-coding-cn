# Code Organization

## Modular Programming

-   Divide code into small, reusable modules or functions, with each module responsible for doing only one thing.
-   Use clear modular structures and directory structures to organize code, making it easier to navigate.

## Naming Conventions

-   Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions so that the purpose of variables, functions, and classes can be understood from their names.
-   Follow naming conventions, such as CamelCase for class names and snake_case for function and variable names.

## Code Comments

-   Add comments to complex code segments to explain the code's functionality and logic.
-   Use block comments (/*...*/) and line comments (//) to distinguish between different types of comments.

## Code Formatting

-   Use consistent code style and formatting rules, and use tools like Prettier or Black to automatically format code.
-   Use blank lines, indentation, and spaces to increase code readability.

# Documentation

## Docstrings

-   Use docstrings at the beginning of each module, class, and function to explain its purpose, parameters, and return values.
-   Choose a consistent docstring format, such as Google Style, NumPy/SciPy Style, or Sphinx Style.

## Automated Document Generation

-   Use tools like Sphinx, Doxygen, or JSDoc to automatically generate documentation from code.
-   Keep documentation and code synchronized to ensure documentation is always up-to-date.

## README File

-   Include a detailed README file in the root directory of each project, explaining the project's purpose, installation steps, usage, and examples.
-   Write README files using Markdown syntax to make them easy to read and maintain.

# Tools

## IDE

-   Use powerful IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IntelliJ, leveraging their code auto-completion, error checking, and debugging features.
-   Configure IDE plugins, such as linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint) and code formatters.
