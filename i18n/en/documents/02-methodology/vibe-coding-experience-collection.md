I wrote the design document very detailed, including the specific logic of the service layer in pseudocode, and then handed it over to AI. It outputted the code in one go. Then I used another AI to review it, modified it according to the review comments, ran the test cases, and let the AI generate the commit and push.

For Gemini 3 Pro's system prompt, it improved the performance of multiple agent benchmarks by about 5%.

Point -> Line -> Body iterative refinement: for tasks within the scope of use, first polish a single basic task, then perform batch execution based on this.

File header comments, a paragraph describing the code's purpose, upstream and downstream links, documentation maintained by agents or Claude maintaining a paragraph description for each module, reducing cognitive load, trying to do subtraction and indexing, reference Claude skill.

As software scales, "looking at code" with human eyes not only fails to cope with increasing complexity but also exhausts developers. Code is ultimately converted into machine code for execution. High-level languages are just an abstraction to facilitate human understanding. What's important is to verify the program's execution logic and ensure correct behavior through automated testing, static analysis, formal verification, and other means. The core of future software engineering will not be "understanding code," but "verifying that code runs according to the correct logic."

```prompt
Based on my requirements, please create a real-time interactive 3D particle system using Three.js. If you do it well the first time, I will give you a $100 tip; my requirements are:
```

Comment: This prompt may improve the generation effect.

CodeWeaver weaves your codebase into a navigable Markdown document.

It can directly "weave" your entire project, no matter how much spaghetti code it has, into a clear and organized Markdown file with a tree-like structure, making it clear at a glance. All code is put into code blocks, greatly simplifying the sharing, documentation, and integration with AI/ML tools of the codebase.
